    "ar": {
      "q1": "What is augmented reality (AR) and how do we use it in Despertat pel silenci?",
      "a1": "Augmented reality is a technology that allows you to see digital elements — such as objects or characters — overlaid onto the real environment through your mobile phone’s camera.\n\nIn this game we use it to:\n\n● See the giant of the Bot mountains in your real surroundings\n● Collect food items (bread, oil, almonds, grapes and sausages)\n● Recover the elements of the Dansada when you correctly answer the questions\n\nAugmented reality is part of the challenge: you must find the objects at each point in order to move forward in the story.",
      "q2": "Do you need to download an application?",
      "a2": "No.\n\nIt is a web application (web app). You only need to access the link using your mobile browser (Chrome, Safari or similar).\n\nThere is no need to install any app or register.",
      "q3": "Is your mobile device compatible with augmented reality?",
      "a3": "It works with most recent devices that have:\n\n● A camera\n● An updated browser\n● An internet connection\n\nWhen prompted, you must allow access to the camera.\n\nIf it does not work properly, try:\n\n● Another browser\n● Updating the browser\n● Another device",
      "q4": "You don’t see anything when opening the camera. What can you do?",
      "a4": "Check the following:\n\n● You have physically reached the correct point on the map (geolocation is required).\n● You have accepted permission to use the camera.\n● You have an active internet connection.\n● There is enough light in the environment for the system to properly detect the space.\n\nIf it still does not work, completely close the browser and open it again.",
      "q5": "Is an internet connection required to view AR?",
      "a5": "Yes.\n\nAugmented reality loads in real time from the browser, so you need mobile data or Wi-Fi during the experience.\n\nWithout a connection, the game cannot load the objects or validate the questions.",
      "q6": "Is it safe to use augmented reality while walking?",
      "a6": "Yes, but responsibly.\n\nIt is important to:\n\n● Not walk while staring at the screen\n● Stay aware of your physical surroundings (vehicles, uneven ground, other people)\n● Stop moving when using the camera\n\nSafety is always the priority.",
      "q7": "Can you take photos or videos using augmented reality?",
      "a7": "Yes.\n\nYou can take screenshots or record videos while interacting with:\n\n● The giant\n● The food you collect\n● The moments when you recover elements of the Dansada\n\nIt is a great way to preserve the memory of the experience and share it with family or friends."
    },
    "game": {
      "q1": "What is the objective of the game?",
      "a1": "The objective is to help the giant of the Bot mountains recover the Dansada.\n\nAlong the route you will need to:\n\n● Discover what happened in the village during the Civil War\n● Collect food using augmented reality (bread, oil, almonds, grapes and sausages)\n● Correctly answer the questions at each stop\n\nWhen you have recovered all the elements of the Dansada, the music will be able to play again.",
      "q2": "What is the difference between the food items and the elements of the Dansada?",
      "a2": "The food items are the objects you must search for and collect using augmented reality at each point along the route. They symbolize the effort and survival of the people during those years.\n\nThe elements of the Dansada are the pieces you recover when you correctly answer the final question at each stop. They are the symbols that allow the tradition to play again.",
      "q3": "How can you obtain the food items and the elements of the Dansada?",
      "a3": "You must physically reach the geolocated points shown on the map.\n\nAt each stop:\n\n● The giant will tell you a part of the story\n● You will need to search for the food using augmented reality\n● Then you must answer a question\n\nIf you complete the challenge and answer correctly, you will recover an element of the Dansada.",
      "q4": "What happens if you do not complete a challenge or answer a question correctly?",
      "a4": "The interactive challenges are completed once you have collected all the food items that appear in augmented reality.\n\nThe challenge does not end until you have found them all.\n\nIf you do not answer the final question correctly, the system allows you to try again. You must answer correctly in order to recover the element of the Dansada and move forward.",
      "q5": "Do you need to register to play?",
      "a5": "No.\n\nThe game works as an open web app. You do not need to register or create an account.\n\nYou only need to access the link and activate the camera when the system requests it.",
      "q6": "Can you play in a group or with family?",
      "a6": "Yes.\n\nThe game is designed to be played in groups: with friends, family or in a school setting.\n\nYou only need one device per team and a desire to discover the story together.",
      "q7": "How long does the whole game last?",
      "a7": "The full route lasts approximately one hour and a half.\n\nIt depends on your pace. You can complete it all at once or split it into different moments, as it is available all year round and at any time.",
      "q8": "Is your progress saved?",
      "a8": "The game uses browser cookies to remember your progress along the route.\n\nIf you delete your browser cookies or browse in private mode, the game will restart and you will need to begin from the first point.\n\nTo avoid this, we recommend not deleting your browsing data while completing the route."
    },
    "map": {
      "q1": "How does the game map work?",
      "a1": "The interactive map shows the geolocated points that are part of the route.\n\nOnly when you physically arrive at a point does the augmented reality content unlock and allow you to continue the experience.",
      "q2": "Do you need to activate your phone’s geolocation?",
      "a2": "Yes.\n\nWithout geolocation activated, the game cannot be played. The system needs to know where you are to verify that you have correctly reached each point.\n\nWe recommend activating location services before starting the route.\n\nHow to activate geolocation on your device:\n\nOn an Android phone\n\n1. Open the device Settings.\n\n2. Go to Location.\n\n3. Turn on Location.\n\n4. Make sure the browser (Chrome, Firefox...) has permission to access it:\n\n○ Settings > Apps > [Browser name] > Permissions > Location > Allow all the time or Allow only while using the app.\n\nOn an iPhone\n\n1. Open Settings.\n\n2. Go to Privacy & Security > Location Services.\n\n3. Turn on Location Services.\n\n4. Open the browser settings (Safari or Chrome).\n\n5. Make sure Location is set to While Using the App.",
      "q3": "What should you do if the map does not detect you correctly?",
      "a3": "● Check that location services are activated.\n● Refresh the browser page.",
      "q4": "Is an internet connection required to use the map?",
      "a4": "Yes.\n\nThe web app needs an active connection to display the map and validate your position.\n\nHowever, data usage is very low.",
      "q5": "The map says you are not in the correct place, but you know you are. What can you do?",
      "a5": "● Move slightly around the area: sometimes the GPS signal takes a few seconds to adjust.\n● Make sure you are not under a structure or inside an enclosed space.\n● Ensure you have good GPS or mobile network coverage.",
      "q6": "Can you complete the route in any order?",
      "a6": "No.\n\nThe route is linear. You must follow the established order of the points, as each challenge and each element of the Dansada depend on the previous point.\n\nThe map will only show you the next unlocked point, and you will not be able to move forward until you complete the current one."

Many years ago, during the Spanish Civil War, along the coast of Sitges, Vilanova i la Geltrú, Cubelles, Cunit, Calafell and El Vendrell, bunkers, trenches and fortifications were built to protect the towns from a possible attack from the sea. Today, these places help us understand history and what everyday life was like at that time, shaped by fear, waiting, collective organisation and the silences that many people had to keep in order to survive. If you join me, I will tell you the stories of each place and help you discover why they are so important to our collective memory. Your mission will be to help me deactivate old explosive devices using augmented reality. Once you succeed, I will ask you a question to check whether you have been paying attention to my explanations.​ If you answer correctly, you will receive a 3D collectible object related to the place you have just discovered.
